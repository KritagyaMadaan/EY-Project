📌 Overview

The Autonomous Predictive Maintenance System is an AI-powered platform designed to continuously monitor, diagnose, and predict the health of vehicles in a fleet. Using real-time telemetry, ML models, and an intuitive visual interface, the system helps reduce breakdowns, optimize maintenance cycles, and improve fleet reliability.

This project demonstrates:
✔️ Autonomous fleet scanning
✔️ Real-time health diagnosis
✔️ Predictive maintenance alerts
✔️ Intuitive mechanic-friendly UI
✔️ Smart visualization of engine components

🎯 Features
🔍 1. Autonomous Fleet Scanning

Automatically detects all active vehicles in the fleet.

Displays driver & vehicle details (e.g., name, ID, registration).

🧠 2. Fleet Brain – AI Engine

Uses ML models to evaluate engine parameters.

Predicts upcoming failures (battery, engine, brakes, etc.).

Prevents downtime using intelligent alerts.

⚙️ 3. Visual Breakdown of Vehicle Health

Real-time 3D-like visualization of critical components (e.g., engine, gearbox).

Animated overlays highlighting parts under stress.

🧰 4. Mechanic-Optimized UI

Clean, distraction-free interface for technicians.

Uses simple colors and animations for quick diagnostics.

📡 5. Edge-Ready Telemetry Integration

Supports IoT sensor data.

Can plug into Arduino/ESP32/Raspberry Pi based sensor feeds.

⚡ How It Works
1. Scan Fleet

User clicks SCAN FLEET → system enumerates all connected vehicles.

2. AI Health Check

Telemetry is analyzed using ML models such as:

LSTM for anomaly detection

Random Forest for failure classification

Regression models for life-cycle prediction

3. Visualization Layer

Engine & components are overlayed with animated wireframes (like in your GIF).

4. Predictive Alerts

User receives alerts such as:

“High vibration detected → Probable bearing wear in 5 days”

“Engine overheating trend → Check coolant system”
